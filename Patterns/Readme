# Striver A2Z – Pattern Problems (First 10)

This repository contains my solutions to the **first 10 pattern problems** from **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet**.  
The goal of this project is to strengthen **loop logic, nested iteration, and pattern visualization** using C++.

## 🧩 Patterns Covered

The first 10 patterns include:
- Square star pattern
- Right-angled triangle
- Number patterns
- Inverted patterns
- Increasing & decreasing star patterns
- Simple logic-based pattern formations

These problems focus on:
- `for` loops
- Nested loops
- Row–column relationships
- Output formatting

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Compiler:** GCC / any standard C++ compiler
- **Concepts Used:**
  - Loops
  - Conditional statements
  - Pattern logic

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
````

2. Navigate to the patterns folder:

   ```bash
   cd patterns
   ```
3. Compile and run any pattern file:

   ```bash
   g++ pattern1.cpp -o pattern1
   ./pattern1
   ```

## 🎯 Purpose

* Build strong fundamentals in loops
* Improve logical thinking
* Prepare for DSA and coding interviews
* Follow Striver’s structured learning path

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

* Complete all remaining patterns from Striver’s sheet
* Add comments explaining logic
* Organize patterns level-wise (Easy → Hard)
