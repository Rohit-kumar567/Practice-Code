# Striver DSA Patterns – Part 2 (Problems 11–22)

This folder contains solutions for **Striver’s DSA Pattern Series – Patterns 11 to 22**.  
These patterns focus on **number logic, symmetry, spacing, and advanced loop control**.

Practicing these patterns helps build a strong foundation for:
- Nested loops
- Mathematical thinking
- Row–column relationships
- Problem-solving skills required for DSA

## 🧩 Pattern List & Description

### 🔹 Pattern 11 – Binary Number Triangle
Prints a triangle of alternating `0` and `1` based on row and column positions.

Example:
```

1
0 1
1 0 1
0 1 0 1

```

---

### 🔹 Pattern 12 – Number Crown Pattern
Prints numbers increasing on the left and decreasing on the right with spaces in between.

Example:
```

1      1
1 2  2 1
1 2 3 3 2 1

```

---

### 🔹 Pattern 13 – Increasing Number Triangle
Prints continuous increasing numbers in a triangular format.

Example:
```

1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
